title: "Viewing test history"

You can view Galasa test history in the **Test History** page. 

The **Test History** page provides a table of information about previous Galasa test runs, with the most recent test runs on top. The *Result, Run Name, Test Class, Start* and *Finished time* for each test are displayed as default. When the page first loads, the table is populated with the last 24 hours of test history. You can select a different timeframe by using the Filter tests toolbar.

##  Customising the results view

The information about *Result*, *Test Class* and *End time* in the results table are sortable. To sort a column alphabetically or chronologically, simply click the column header. Change the number of test runs that are displayed on each page and jump between pages by using the pagination bar.

A side navigation toolbar provides five options that enable you to customise the view of your test history in the **Test History** page:
### The Organise table toolbar 
![Organise table icon](../../images/table.svg)
Set the table height to either regular or compressed, and the text format to either no wrap or wrap. Choose to show or hide columns of information about the test runs. For example, options such as *Bundle*, *Short Name*, *LPAR*, *Requestor*, *Requested time*, *Metadata* and *Pass History* are hidden from the table when the page first loads but can be added to the table by using this toolbar. Alternatively, you can hide any of the default columns apart from *Result* and *Run Name*.
### The Filter tests toolbar
Filter test history by *Test Class*, *Bundle*, *Requestor* and *Result*. View tests that ran within a specific timeframe, or that completed more than 24 hours previously by setting a time range. If there is a combination of filters that are used regularly, save this set of filters by clicking *Add to saved filters* at the bottom of the toolbar.
### The Compare list toolbar
Select specific test runs by using the checkboxes in the *Compare* column of the table to add these runs to a short list where you can switch quickly between them to compare information about the runs.
### The Worklist toolbar
Select test runs by using the checkboxes in the *Worklist* column of the table. You can save runs into separate worklists that you can come back to later.
### The Help toolbar
Switch the help tooltips on or off. This toolbar also guides you to our FAQ page, documentation, and support.
