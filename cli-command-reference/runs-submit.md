The `runs submit` command submits and monitors tests in the Galasa Ecosystem.  Tests can be input either from a portfolio or directly from a test package. 

For information about creating a portfolio by using the Galasa CLI, see the documentation for the `runs prepare` command.

## Working with the `runs submit` command

The following section provides a subset of examples of how you can use the `runs submit` command to complete various tasks, for example, getting help, submitting tests, and setting overrides. The examples build on the Galasa SimBank tests, which you can run non-locally if you have an ecosystem that is running SimPlatform.


### Submitting tests to an ecosystem from a portfolio

The following example assumes that you have created a `test.yaml` portfolio by using the [runs prepare](./ecosystem-cli-runs-prepare) command. The command submits tests from the `test.yaml` portfolio, and specifies the following settings.

On Mac or Unix:

```
galasactl runs submit \
                        --portfolio test.yaml \ 
                        --poll 5 \
                        --progress 1 \
                        --throttle 5 \
                        --log -
```

On Windows (Powershell):

```
galasactl runs submit `
                        --portfolio test.yaml ` 
                        --poll 5 `
                        --progress 1 `
                        --throttle 5 `
                        --log -
```

where: 
- `poll` specifies the frequency in seconds that the CLI polls the Ecosystem for test run status. 
- `progress` specifies the frequency in minutes that the CLI reports the overall progress of the test runs. A value of  `-1` or less disables progress reports.
- `throttle` specifies the number of test runs that can be submitted in parallel. A value of `0` or less  prevents throttling.
- `log` specifies that the progress log should be directed somewhere, and the `-` means that it should be sent to the console (stderr) so it is visible.



### Submitting tests without a portfolio

You can use test class names to submit test runs without using a portfolio.

The following command runs the `SimBankIVT` and `BasicAccountCreditTest` tests from the  `dev.galasa.simbank.tests` package.

On Mac or Unix:

```
galasactl runs submit \
                        --class dev.galasa.simbank.tests/SimBankIVT \
                        --class dev.galasa.simbank.tests/BasicAccountCreditTest \
                        --log -
```

On Windows (Powershell):

```
galasactl runs submit `
                        --class dev.galasa.simbank.tests/SimBankIVT `
                        --class dev.galasa.simbank.tests/BasicAccountCreditTest `
                        --log -
```


### Setting overrides for all tests during a run

Specifying overrides is useful if you want to run a set of tests against a particular configuration without changing the test code. For example, you might have multiple versions of software that you need to test. How can you do that without changing the test code? The answer is to use override properties. If you are running tests locally, you can set overrides properties by editing your `Overrides Properties` file. If you are running tests in an ecosystem, you can use the `--override` parameter in the Galasa CLI. Note that overrides in the portfolio take precedence over the overrides on the `runs submit` command. This is so that you can set general overrides on the submit, but have specific class overrides in the portfolio. 

The following command runs all the tests in the `test.yaml` portfolio are on the z/OS LPAR `MYLPAR` in the `MYPLEX` cluster.

On Mac or Unix:

```
galasactl runs submit \
                        --portfolio test.yaml \
                        --override zos.default.lpar=MYLPAR \
                        --override zos.default.cluster=MYPLEX \
                        --log -
```

On Windows (Powershell):

```
galasactl runs submit `
                        --portfolio test.yaml `
                        --override zos.default.lpar=MYLPAR `
                        --override zos.default.cluster=MYPLEX `
                        --log -
```
