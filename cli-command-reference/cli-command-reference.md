If you are installing Galasa for using in the command-line, you can use the Galasa command line interface tool (Galasa CLI) to interact with Galasa to complete tasks, for example, to create Galasa projects, submit tests to an ecosystem, view test results and download test artifacts. You can use the same set of Galasa CLI commands to run a given task, regardless of the technology that you are using.


## Next steps

To install Galasa for using in the command line, follow the instructions in the [Installing the Galasa CLI](/docs/cli-command-reference/installing-cli-tool) documentation.
