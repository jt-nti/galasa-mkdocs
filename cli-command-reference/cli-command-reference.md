title: "Getting started using the Galasa CLI"
---


If you are installing Galasa for using in the command-line, you can use the Galasa command line interface (CLI) tool (galasactl) to interact with Galasa. The galasactl tool helps you to set up your environment for developing Galasa tests, generate sample Galasa test code, and submit and monitor Galasa test runs. 

The same set of Galasa CLI commands can be used to run a given task, regardless of the technology that you are using. 

The following topics in this section take you through the software requirements, and explain how to download and install the galasactl tool. You can then find out how to initialise your local environment so that you can start creating, building and running Galasa tests, and viewing the test run output. 

## Next steps

To learn about the software that you need to install to start using Galasa, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/cli-command-reference/cli-prereqs) documentation.

You can also watch a video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYOwJZ4Q8Q" target="_blank">The Galasa command line tool</a>, which guides you through the process of setting up and using the tool from start to finish.
