Galasa SimBank comes with a selection of prepared Galasa tests that you can start exploring to understand more about Galasa tests and their structure. To start working with the example tests, you need to set up an example Galasa project within Eclipse. 

If you are using the Galasa plug-in from the external update site, you can use either Maven or Gradle to build your example project. 

If you are using Maven to build your project, follow the instructions in [Creating a project using Maven](/docs/creating-project-Galasa/creating-project-Maven). 

If you are using Gradle to build your project, follow the instructions in [Creating a project using Gradle](/docs/creating-project-Galasa/creating-project-online-Gradle).

If you are using the Galasa zipped distribution, you must use Gradle to build your example project, so follow the instructions in the [Creating a project using Gradle with the zipped distribution](/docs/creating-project-Galasa/creating-project-offline-Gradle).
