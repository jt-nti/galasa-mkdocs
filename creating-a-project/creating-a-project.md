Galasa SimBank comes with a selection of prepared Galasa tests that you can start exploring to understand more about Galasa tests and their structure. To start working with the example tests, you need to set up a Galasa project within Eclipse. 

If you are using the Galasa plug-in from the external update site, you can use either Maven or Gradle to build your projects. 

If you are using Maven to build your project, follow the instructions in [Creating a project using Maven](/docs/creating-project-Galasa/creating-project-Maven). 

If you are using Gradle to build your project, follow the instructions in _Creating a project using Gradle_.

If you are using the Galasa zipped distribution you must use Gradle to build your projects, so follow the instructions in the _Creating a project using Gradle with the zipped distribution_.
