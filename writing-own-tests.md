title: "Writing your own independent Galasa tests"
---

Writing your own tests (that is, tests within an independent project of your own creation) involves two kinds of activity:

- Using the Galasa CLI to create an appropriate project structure.
- Leveraging a collection of organisational principles that will help guide you towards a clean implementation that can eventually be moved into CI/CD and full automation.

These two strands involve exploiting the features of a well-known and trusted Open Source application called Maven for project setup and dependency management.

Our approach provides enough detail to get you going, but for a full understanding you either need some prior knowledge or to undertake a little self-study. There are plenty of resources on the Web, and you will find that your appreciation of Maven will grow as you interact day-to-day with Galasa itself.
