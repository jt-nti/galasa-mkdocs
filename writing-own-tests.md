title: "Writing your own independent Galasa tests"
---

Writing your own tests (that is, tests within an independent project of your own creation) involves two kinds of activity:

- Setting up your IDE (currently just Eclipse) to create an appropriate project structure.
- Leveraging a collection of less tangible - but important - principles that will help guide you towards a clean implementation that can eventually be moved into CI/CD and full automation.

These two strands involve exploiting the features of well-known and trusted Open Source applications, such as Maven (for project setup and dependency management) and Docker (to pave the way towards automation).

Our approach provides enough detail to get you going, but for a full understanding you either need some prior knowledge or to undertake a little self-study. There are plenty of resources on the Web, and you will find that your appreciation of Maven and Docker will grow as you interact day-to-day with Galasa itself.
