This section takes you through the options available for installing the Galasa Eclipse plug-in and a quick tour of its capabilities on a local machine.

## Installing options
You can install Galasa either from a downloadable zip file (zipped distribution) or directly from an update site. 

The zipped distribution allows users who do not have access to Maven Central, Eclipse Marketplace and Docker Hub from their company network to use Galasa. Users without restricted internet access who want to use open-source Galasa, can install Galasa directly from the `https://p2.galasa.dev/` update site.

To install the Galasa plug-in using the offline zipped distribution, follow the instructions in [installing the Galasa plug-in using the zipped distribution](/docs/getting-started/installing-offline). 

To install the Galasa plug-in from the online update site, follow the instructions in [installing the Galasa plug-in online](/docs/getting-started/installing-online). 

You can then start [exploring Galasa Simbank](/docs/getting-started/simbank); a component distributed with Galasa that you can start playing with to help you to learn about the Galasa basics. 

## Audience
To write and run simple Galasa tests, you need a modest knowledge of Java. Even if your application under test is written in a completely different language, you need to understand enough Java to be able to create all of your required tests.
