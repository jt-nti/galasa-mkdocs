Before development of the Galasa command line tool (galasactl), Eclipse was the main focus for getting started with using Galasa and exploring Simbank and it continues to provide an alternative UI experience to the equivalent command line option.


## Downloading and Installing 

You can download Galasa either from a downloadable zip file (zipped distribution) or directly from an external update site. For more information about these options, see the [Introduction](/docs/doc_root) documentation. 

To install the Galasa plug-in from the external update site, follow the instructions in [Installing the Galasa plug-in](/docs/getting-started/installing-online). 

To install the Galasa plug-in using the zipped distribution, follow the instructions in [Installing the Galasa plug-in offline](/docs/getting-started/installing-offline). 


## Next steps 

You can then start [exploring Galasa Simbank](/docs/getting-started/simbank); a component distributed with Galasa that you can start playing with to help you to learn about the Galasa basics.
