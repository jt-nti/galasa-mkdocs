This section takes you through the installation of the Galasa Eclipse plug-in and a quick tour of its capabilities on a local machine.

## Audience
To write and run simple Galasa tests, you need a modest knowledge of Java. Even if your application under test is written in a completely different language, you need to understand enough Java to be able to create all of your required tests.

Get started by [installing the Galasa plug-in](/docs/getting-started/installing) before [exploring Galasa Simbank](/docs/getting-started/simbank); a component distributed with Galasa that you can start playing with to help you to learn about the Galasa basics.
