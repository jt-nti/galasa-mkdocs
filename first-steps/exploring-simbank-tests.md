Galasa SimBank comes with a selection of prepared Galasa tests. You can find out more about these tests in the following sections. Follow the flow of logic in these classes and understand more about the Java that is used to create them, including how to use Galasa annotations and review documented test methods.

A good place to start is with the [SimBank IVT](/docs/running-simbank-tests/simbank-IVT) documentation. You can then move on to look at the other tests that are provided with Galasa.
