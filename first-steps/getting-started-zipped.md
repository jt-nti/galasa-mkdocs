You can download Galasa from a downloadable zip file (zipped distribution) for use offline if you do not have access to Maven Central or Docker Hub from your company network. To install the Galasa CLI using the zipped distribution, check you have installed the [Zipped distribution pre-requisite software](../first-steps/zipped-prerequisites) that you need to start using Galasa. You can then follow the instructions in [Installing the Galasa CLI](../first-steps/installing-offline) documentation.
