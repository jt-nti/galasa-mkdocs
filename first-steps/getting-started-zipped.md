You can download Galasa from a downloadable zip file (zipped distribution). To install the Galasa plug-in using the zipped distribution, check you have installed the [pre-requisite software](zipped-prequisites) that you need to start using Galasa. Yout can then follow the instructions in [Installing the Galasa plug-in offline](installing-offline) documentation.

## Next steps

You can then start [exploring Galasa Simbank](../cli-command-reference/simbank-cli.md); a component distributed with Galasa that you can start playing with to help you to learn about the Galasa basics.
