Galasa SimBank comes with a selection of prepared Galasa tests:

- A basic Installation Verification Test (IVT) logs on to SimBank and examines an account - `SimBankIVT.java`.
- A test that updates an account using web services and examines the changes with 3270 screens - `BasicAccountCreditTest.java`.
- A test that uses a provisioned account object to perform the same test as above in an improved test design - `ProvisionedAccountCreditTests.java`.
- A test that exercises the z/OS Batch Manager by simulating the submission of a JCL job to add a number of accounts to the SimBank system - `BatchAccountsOpenTest.java`.

All of these example tests become available when you set up a Galasa example project within Eclipse.

## Creating an example Galasa project

<b>NOTE:</b> Normally m2e (the Eclipse Maven plug-in) automatically compiles the test bundles and produces the necessary manifest and OSGi files. However, there appears to be an anomaly in m2e in the 2019 versions of Eclipse which we are investigating. If the bundles fail to build correctly, you can force the Maven build by right-clicking the _project_ and selecting _Run As > Maven Install_. We will resolve this issue in a future release.

1. Ensure that Eclipse is running.
1. Choose _File > New > Example_, select _SimBank example projects_ and press _Next_.
1. Confirm your _New project_ prefix (it's OK to leave it as `dev.galasa.simbank`) and press _Finish_. In your _Package Explorer_ (if it's not visible, choose _Window > Show View > Package Explorer_), two new entries appear:

```
dev.galasa.simbank.manager
dev.galasa.simbank.testsÂ 
```

1. Right-click on `dev.galasa.simbank.manager` and choose _Run As > Maven install_ - wait a few moments for the dependencies to load and then right-click on `dev.galasa.simbank.tests` and do the same. Note that the order in which you do this is significant - first `dev.galasa.simbank.manager` and then `dev.galasa.simbank.tests`.
1. Expand `dev.galasa.simbank.tests` (assuming you haven't changed your project name) and then `src.main.java` - and finally, explore the `dev.galasa.simbanks.tests` package. You'll see the group of tests provided with SimBank:

Explore these tests by selecting from the left-hand menu - if you are new to Galasa, _The SimBank IVT_ is the best place to start.
