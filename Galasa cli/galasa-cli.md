Use the Galasa command line interface (Galasa CLI) to help you complete tasks, for example, submitting and monitoring Galasa test runs. You can use the same set of Galasa CLI commands to run a given task, regardless of the technology that you are using to run your pipeline.

## Getting started 

To use the Galasa CLI commands you must reference the Galasa bootstrap file or URL. You can do this either by setting the `--bootstrap` flag or the `GALASA_BOOTSTRAP`environment variable.

You can [access the code](https://github.com/galasa-dev/cli) and [download the CLI tool](https://github.com/galasa-dev/cli/releases) from the _cli_ repository in GitHub. The following versions of the Galasa CLI tool are available to download for different operating systems:

- galasactl-darwin-amd64
- galasactl-linux-amd64
- galasactl-linux-s390x
- galasactl-windows-amd64.exe

For information on the commands that are currently available and examples of how to use them, see the [Command Reference](/docs/cli-command-reference/cli-command-reference) documentation.
