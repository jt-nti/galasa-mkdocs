## Overview
This Manager provides the tester with the capability to                      connect to a Linux image as part of a test and to access                      the command shell. Standard commands can then be run on                      the image. The Linux Manager has a dependency on the IP Network                      Manager, which establishes an IP connection to the image.     <br><br>                                                                               You can view the <a href=                     "https://javadoc.galasa.dev/dev/galasa/linux/package-summary.html"                     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javadoc                     documentation for the Manager here</a>. <br>                     <br>
