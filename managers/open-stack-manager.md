## Overview
This Manager enables Galasa to provision Linux images                      on a provided Open Stack instance.                        Use the Open Stack Manager to create the instances                      and to set up the networking required to make the images                      accessible to the tester.                                         The Open Stack Manager has a dependency on the Linux Manager.
