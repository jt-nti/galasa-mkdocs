# Getting started with Galasa
This section takes you through installation and initial familiarization with Galasa's intrinsic functionality on a local machine, moving on to its support for more powerful and complex options such as executing mainframe tests, running in a Kubernetes cluster, or integrating Galasa with your DevOps pipeline.

If you are new to Galasa, it is highly-recommended that you follow this sequence of activities - they build in a logical progression designed to get you operational as fast as possible. You can stop as soon as you feel comfortable that you have learned enough to be productive in your own testing environment - you don't need to be a mainframe user or run Galasa in a Kubernetes cluster to benefit from incorporating it in your development workflow.
