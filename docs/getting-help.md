If you find any problems whilst youâ€™re using Galasa, get in touch and get the help you need: 

1) Search our project management repository on GitHub and our Galasa Slack channel, perhaps someone has already had a similar issue and solved it.
2) If you have an error message or java stack trace, feel free to raise an issue in the project management repository and the Galasa community will get back to you as soon as possible.
3) If you have a question or a query, try our Galasa Slack channel.  Here, experts and users from the community can come together to help you out and answer your question.

If your issue requires a code change, the community will do their best to respond and fix the problem as soon as they can.  Depending on the severity of the issue, the fix might be scheduled for a future release of Galasa. Alternatively, the fix might be back ported to the current release.  Naturally this is always a community decision and your input is just as important.  

If you want to have a go at fixing the defect yourself, let us know and we will help you to try and fix the issue.

We are open to suggestions about more formal support, come and talk to us - we would love to hear from you.
