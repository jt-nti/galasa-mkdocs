You can write Galasa tests as a JUnit-style Java class and run them locally from your IDE or in automation without having to change a single line of code. Deep z/OS integration means you can verify data by interrogating the CICS application directly and gives you the ability to check other z/OS resources, such as messages on queues, without using stubs or mocking.
