Galasa can integrate with your test data strategy by helping you to provision new or existing test data records. Galasa can also lock test data so that many tests can run in parallel against the same test data pool, making it easy to repeat tests under identical conditions for swift debugging. Provisioned environments are automatically deprovisioned at test completion, leaving a clean test system state ready for the next tests.
