title: "Getting started with Galasa"

This section takes you through the installation of Galasa and offers an initial familiarization with its capabilities on a local machine.

## Audience
To write and run simple Galasa tests, you need a modest knowledge of Java. If you are happy writing, say, JUnit tests, you are good to go. Even if your application under test is written in a completely different language, you need to understand enough Java to be able to create all of your required tests.

Writing your own Galasa managers is more involved, but the difference is incremental, not an order of magnitude. Much of the complexity has already been abstracted out in the design of Galasa's underlying framework.
