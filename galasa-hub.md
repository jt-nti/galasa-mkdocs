## Blog: Galasa: What is Application Integration Testing?
Application integration allows software to be created as a unique and bespoke set of applications that knit together to form critical business processes. Application integration testing ensures that individual components interact with each other in a desirable way, and automation of this stage of testing is critical because there typically are so many configurations, routes, and scenarios to consider. Galasa could be your first step to understanding how to build test cases that cover multiple applications and can even be extended to cover proprietary applications with the use of Managers.

## Video: The Galasa Configuration Property Store
Integration testing can be complicated. Tests often require configuration parameters to bind to a specific test environment. Galasa Managers require configuration so that systems under test can be contacted. This information needs to stored in a single, central repository that is shareable to the Galasa framework, Ecosystem, Managers and tests. Find out how Galasa solves these challenges by its use of the Configuration Property Store (CPS). Watch the video to understand the features of the Galasa CPS, and see a demonstration on manipulating the values in a CPS by using the Galasa command line (Galasa CLI). Use the information to help you to simplify your test configuration, set Ecosystem-wide configuration properties, and set parameters and credentials on the Ecosystem for tests to read and use at runtime.<br>
