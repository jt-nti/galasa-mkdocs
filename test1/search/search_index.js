The same test must also be capable of running against multiple z/OS environments without code changes.  Galasa is designed to work in hybrid cloud applications, operating with the entire application stack, so you can provision in a cloud environment, but bind to a z/OS test environment. The Galasa framework integrates and wrappers multiple techonolgies and test tooling in a consistent way, providing a platform to test different aspects of the application stack in the same language and in the same fashion. One test case can interact with 3270 emulators, Selenium, JMeter, batch jobs and other applications.   Verification and validation without mocking or stubbing  Verifying and validating data at every boundary without stubbing or mocking is hard.  Galasa enables real data verification by interrogating a CICS (or other) application directly or by enabling the checking of other z/OS resources, for example, messages on queues or the updating of log streams.  Reliability and availability of test data  Test data is often in a state of flux, resulting in the breaking of existing tests and difficulty in snapshotting and data integrity.  Galasa provides the mechanisms through the use of Application Managers to either generate test data on the fly, or to locate valid test data from a data lake. Data can then be locked whilst in use, preventing cross contamination with other running tests.  You can integrate Galasa tests with your existing tooling, allowing you to share data between tools within the same test.  Running the same test locally and in automation  Tests need to be run on demand and in automation. Running and re-running manual tests is laborious, time consuming and not exactly the best use of a tester's skills or time.  Galasa tests can be run locally from your own IDE, or in automation without changing a single line of test code.   With Galasa you can automate and automatically schedule these repetitive regression tests and use the time saved to free up testers to spend their time designing test cases that are more likely to find important defects.  Once written, a Galasa test is available 24x7 for reuse."},{"location":"about/different.html#centralizing-maintaining-and-storing-results-consistently","title":"Centralizing, maintaining and storing results consistently:","text":"Maintaining, recording and planning with a large suite of tests  Maintaining a set of test materials (which could be written in several different languages), recording which tests have been run, and scheduling any outstanding tests is difficult and time consuming. Manual tests are often split across teams and reported separately, with no single, consistent view of the testing.  The Galasa test catalog provides the ability to generate a clear description of the areas covered by any given test. Related tests can be stored within a shared test catalog, from which tests can be automatically selected to run for any given change set. Automated regression test suites can be created for new software versions, so you can run a specified set of tests for automated baselining of a new environment installation, such as a hardware migration.   Diagnosing failures   Investigating test failures takes up time and can be particularly tedious with larger scripts. Test artifacts are often stored in lots of different repositories, making it time-consuming and difficult to locate the right information to help you root out the cause of a failure.  Galasa automatically stores all test artifacts in a single, central repository, making diagnostics quicker and easier and allowing big picture information to be extracted easily. You can also debug tests using a local instance of Galasa, so you can examine every line of code.  Big picture communication  Test results are often stored in spreadsheets and manually approved by product owners before changes are promoted. This makes it difficult to understand the tests that have been run, and the manual intervention required as part of the sign-off process can delay delivery.  Galasa's dashboard integrates all your test results in one place, making reporting and reviewing between test phases easy and consistent."},{"location":"about/different.html#extensibility-and-scalability-future-proofing-your-testing","title":"Extensibility and scalability - future-proofing your testing:","text":"Maintaining performance levels  Running scripts and tooling on tools such as Jenkins can lead to performance issues \u2013 ideally the tests and the Jenkins nodes should not share workload. Whilst you don\u2019t want to miss defects by limiting the number of tests run, the more tests that are running the longer the testing phase takes, and the increased amount of computer resources that are required from the Jenkins node will limit the throughput. Locking resources within the framework prevents tests from colliding; instead tests are queued until those resources become available.  Galasa\u2019s tests as a service allows the test workload to be moved off a Jenkins node, with the added benefit of being capable to scale horizontally in its own cloud environment.   Expanding pipelines   The addition of new 3rd party tooling can lead to problems with managing test artifacts. Maintaining, updating and ensuring compliance on Jenkins servers with increasing numbers of plugins is time-consuming.   Galasa is open source so can be extended to support additional specific tooling. In addition, Galasa manages its own plugins, so less manual intervention is required for installation and updates.    Deep integration testing at scale  It can be difficult to ensure that testing across cloud and z/OS platforms is kept aligned.  If z/OS is the best place for the application to run, but developing a solution there is slower than elsewhere, it can cause problems. Manual testing can be tedious and error prone, making it time consuming to get an entire application thoroughly tested, both in terms of depth of testing and in breadth of coverage.  Galasa tests can scale horizontally without changing the underlying test code and the framework enables test isolation, so that multiple tests can run in parallel, logically isolated by the framework.  Minimizing manual intervention  Manual testing involves a significant amount of human intervention, which means tests can take too long to write and are hard to understand and maintain. This process is particularly laborious and expensive when problems are found and re-builds required.  Galasa makes tests quicker to write and easier to maintain by extracting the boilerplate code out of the tests. Just import the components you need from within your test code to access the abstracted functionality, gaining the benefit of the expertise of the person who wrote them, and the productivity introduced by their simple use."},{"location":"about/different.html#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Galasa is an open source deep integration test framework for teams looking to give more power to their testers.

It was created to help eliminate repetitive manual and semi-automated testing. These manual tests could be complex and take a long time to set up and run, increasing the risk of introducing human-error into the process. It was also time-consuming to identify the cause of failures, as diagnostics were stored in different repositories, including logs and program compilation output on z/OS, and test script log output on laptops.

The returned result shows the path to your JDK installation. Maven or Gradle You must install either Maven or Gradle in order to build Galasa projects. Galasa projects are hierarchical file structures that provide the ability to store and run Galasa tests. All Galasa versions are compatible with Gradle releases 6.9.x. Remember to add Gradle to your Path. You can check by running <code>echo $PATH</code> on Mac or Unix, or <code>echo %PATH%</code> on Windows (PowerShell). 3270 emulator Optional. Although you do not need a 3270 emulator to run a Galasa test (even if it tests a 3270 application) you can use one to run Galasa Simbank online, a simulated version of an application that helps you get acquainted with Galasa before connecting to a real mainframe to run your own tests.

If you are running a test on your local machine, the bootstrap file is blank as it does not need to refer to the Ecosystem. cps.properties The configuration property store (CPS) defines object properties, topologies, system configurations, and definitions which instruct the way in which a Galasa test runs. For example, properties for endpoints, ports and timeouts. When running in an Ecosystem, all Galasa tests will use the same CPS configuration, unless any overrides are passed at submission. It is the CPS and the configurational properties that enable tests to run against multiple environments, without changing the code inside the test. You can extract a test property value from the CPS file for use in a test by using the <code>@TestProperty</code> annotation that is provided by the Core Manager. credentials.properties It is likely that a test will need to pass credentials to the application being tested. For example, as HTTP credentials or as username and password values entered onto a 3270 screen. Rather than hard code the credentials inside a test class, you can store the values in the credentials.properties file when the test is run locally. The ability to get credentials from a credentials store means that you do not need to hard code these values inside a test, enabling the test to be run in different environments without changing a single line of code. You can extract credentials to use in your test by using the <code>getCredentials</code> method that is provided by the Core Manager. dss.properties In a local environment, or when running tests locally within a pipeline, the Dynamic Status Store (DSS) is stored in a file. In an Ecosystem, the DSS is hosted on the <code>etcd</code> server. The DSS contains a number of settings, and counters that Managers put there, to indicate what resources are currently in-use so far. If a z/OS machine only has 10 ports configured for example, the counter reaches 10, which will prevent any more tests trying to allocate a port for them to use. There is a danger if tests are stopped, that the proper clean-up is skipped, and the port number doesn't decrease when a test owning that port stops abnormally. Normal operation of an Ecosystem includes a resource monitor which looks for this situation and releases resources that a failed test owns. In a local run that isn't present, so the DSS might not accurately reflect the number of resources that are available. To resolve, if no tests are running, you can clear out the <code>dss.properties</code> files in your pipeline, which steps all the counters down to 0.  Note that if you always clear out the dss file, the <code>run name</code> of tests will always start from the same number, as the <code>latest test number allocated</code> counter is also stored in the DSS. overrides.properties Specifying overrides is useful if you want to run a set of tests against a particular configuration without changing the test code. For example, you might have multiple versions of software that you need to test. How can you do that without changing the test code? The answer is to use override properties. If you are running tests locally, you can set overrides properties by editing your overrides properties file."},{"location":"docs/cli-command-reference/initialising-home-folder.html#setting-the-galasa-bootstrap","title":"Setting the Galasa bootstrap","text":"<p>The bootstrap is a simple properties file that contains the information that Galasa needs to bring up a framework to connect to an Ecosystem.

For example, properties for endpoints, ports and timeouts. When running in an ecosystem, all Galasa tests will use the same CPS configuration, unless any overrides are passed at submission. It is the CPS and the configurational properties that enable tests to run against multiple environments, without changing the code inside the test. Note: As IP addresses and ports of test machines are stored within the CPS on a users system, we recommend that hard drive encryption is turned on in the operating system where possible. <code>Dynamic Status Store</code> The dynamic status store (DSS) provides status information about the ecosystem and the tests that are running. The DSS is used by the resource manager and engine controller to ensure the limits that are set in the CPS configuration are not exceeded. DSS property values change dynamically as tests are run, showing the resources that are currently being used, shared or locked by a test, so that workloads can be limited to avoid throttling. When running in automation, the DSS is shared by every instance of the framework. <code>Result Archive Store</code> The result archive store (RAS) is a single database which stores all elements of a test, including the test results, run logs, and test artifacts. These elements can be used to help diagnose the cause of any failures encountered as a result of running a test, or to gather information about a test.  Storing all of this information in one place makes it simple for entire teams to view results. <code>Credentials Store</code> The credentials store (CREDs) securely provides the credentials, for example, password, username and personal access token that are required for a test to run in automation. The CREDs is hosted in the etcd server. <code>etcd</code> The etcd server is a highly available key-value pair store which hosts the Configuration Property Store (CPS), the Dynamic Status Store (DSS) and the Credentials Store (CREDs). The etcd server stores and maintains a single, consistent source of the truth about the status of the ecosystem at any given point in time. <code>CouchDB</code> This database runs inside Docker container or Kubernetes pod and contains the Result Archive Store (RAS). Galasa Servers <code>Engine controller</code> The engine controller enables tests to run at scale within the ecosystem. This service is responsible for instantiating individual test engines by creating Docker containers or Kubernetes pods to manage and execute individual Galasa automation test runs. The engine controller allocates a test engine to a test submission if the required resources for the test are available. Otherwise, the test is put into a waiting state to be run at an appropriate time. <code>Resource Management</code> The resource management service monitors running tests and resources that have been marked as in use. If a test case becomes stale or is ended manually, this service performs clean up actions to ensure that the resources are entered back into the pool for another test to use. This service can perform large pieces of work, including the de-provisioning of an environment. <code>Metrics Server</code> The metrics server indicates the health of the ecosystem, for example, providing metrics on the number of successful test runs. <code>API Server</code> The API server acts as a central point from which to control the Galasa Ecosystem and is used by Galasa as an endpoint with which IDEs and pipelines interact for submitting tests and retrieving results. The API server hosts the bootstrap server. <code>Bootstrap Server</code> The bootstrap server is part of the API server. The bootstrap is an endpoint that is provided by the API server to store the initial configuration required to instantiate a Galasa framework. When setting up the Galasa Ecosystem, the IDE must be updated to point to the bootstrap that is configured to use the ecosystem. <code>Galasa Web UI</code> The Galasa Web UI is currently under construction and planned for a future release. Use the WebUI to see a dashboard overview of the current and historical health of the Galasa framework. The UI can also run, schedule or reschedule tests, be used to analyse output from failed test runs, and manage the configuration needed to customise the framework and  tests for maximum throughput, resilience and flexibility. <code>Dex</code> The Galasa Ecosystem Helm chart's use of Dex is under development and is subject to change. In a future release, Dex will be used to authenticate users interacting with a Galasa Ecosystem. Code Deployment <code>Maven Repositories and OBRs</code> For tests to run in the ecosystem they require compiled artifacts to be hosted in a Maven repository. The artifacts must be bundled as an OSGI bundle -  Galasa provides a Maven plug-in to create these bundles. <code>Nexus</code> A Nexus server enables deployment of Maven artifacts to the ecosystem and can be used to host Docker images. If you have an alternative internal artifact repository, you can use that instead of Nexus. Optional reporting servers <code>Prometheus</code> The Prometheus server scrapes and stores metrics from defined endpoints from the metrics server. These metrics provide information on the rate of  throughput of tests in the ecosystem. <code>Grafana</code> A dashboard for visualizing Prometheus metrics. Data can be explored through queries and drilldown. <code>Elasticsearch</code> Provides an Elastic search instance to record the results of automated test runs. <code>Kabana</code> A dashboard for visualizing Elasticsearch metrics.

If you are running a test on your local machine, the bootstrap file is blank as it does not need to refer to the Ecosystem. cps.properties The configuration property store (CPS) defines object properties, topologies, system configurations, and definitions which instruct the way in which a Galasa test runs. For example, properties for endpoints, ports and timeouts. When running in an Ecosystem, all Galasa tests will use the same CPS configuration, unless any overrides are passed at submission. It is the CPS and the configurational properties that enable tests to run against multiple environments, without changing the code inside the test. You can extract a test property value from the CPS file for use in a test by using the <code>@TestProperty</code> annotation that is provided by the Core Manager. credentials.properties It is likely that a test will need to pass credentials to the application being tested. For example, as HTTP credentials or as username and password values entered onto a 3270 screen. Rather than hard code the credentials inside a test class, you can store the values in the credentials.properties file when the test is run locally. The ability to get credentials from a credentials store means that you do not need to hard code these values inside a test, enabling the test to be run in different environments without changing a single line of code. You can extract credentials to use in your test by using the <code>getCredentials</code> method that is provided by the Core Manager. dss.properties In a local environment, or when running tests locally within a pipeline, the Dynamic Status Store (DSS) is stored in a file. In an Ecosystem, the DSS is hosted on the <code>etcd</code> server. The DSS contains a number of settings, and counters that Managers put there, to indicate what resources are currently in-use so far. If a z/OS machine only has 10 ports configured for example, the counter reaches 10, which will prevent any more tests trying to allocate a port for them to use. There is a danger if tests are stopped, that the proper clean-up is skipped, and the port number doesn't decrease when a test owning that port stops abnormally. Normal operation of an Ecosystem includes a resource monitor which looks for this situation and releases resources that a failed test owns. In a local run that isn't present, so the DSS might not accurately reflect the number of resources that are available. To resolve, if no tests are running, you can clear out the <code>dss.properties</code> files in your pipeline, which steps all the counters down to 0.  Note that if you always clear out the dss file, the <code>run name</code> of tests will always start from the same number, as the <code>latest test number allocated</code> counter is also stored in the DSS. overrides.properties Specifying overrides is useful if you want to run a set of tests against a particular configuration without changing the test code. For example, you might have multiple versions of software that you need to test. How can you do that without changing the test code? The answer is to use override properties. If you are running tests locally, you can set overrides properties by editing your overrides properties file."},{"location":"docs/first-steps/initialising-home-folder.html#setting-the-galasa-bootstrap","title":"Setting the Galasa bootstrap","text":"<p>The bootstrap is a simple properties file that contains the information that Galasa needs to bring up a framework to connect to an Ecosystem.

Helper methods are provided to stream and substitute symbolics within the loaded file.  </p>"},{"location":"docs/managers/artifact-manager.html#code-snippets","title":"Code snippets","text":"<p>Use the following code snippets to help you get started with the Artifact Manager.</p> Create the Artifact Manager  The ArtifactManager allows you to stream resources from within the same bundles as your test class.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the BundleResources annotation:  <pre><code>@BundleResources\npublic IBundleResources resources;\n</code></pre> The resources object now references the list of resources that are held within the test bundle under */src/main/resources/*.  These resources can now be accessed directly by the test code, by calling methods on the resources object.  Alternatively, if the resources are within another class, you can use the ArtifactManager annotation to address the Manager directly:  <pre><code>@ArtifactManager\npublic IArtifactManager artifacts;\n</code></pre>  This will provision an instance of the Artifact Manager.  In order to obtain a IBundleResources object to reference the content of the resources within a test bundle you will need to use the API:  <pre><code>IBundleResources resources = artifacts.getBundleResources(this.getClass());\n</code></pre> Retrieving the content of a file as a string   The simplest thing that a test might want to do is retrieve the content of a file as a string.  First, an input stream to the file location is constructed and then a helper method is invoked to stream the content as a string.  However, if you wanted to read from the input stream yourself, then that option is available to you.  <pre><code>InputStream is = resources.retrieveFile(\"input/hobbit.txt\");\nString textContext = resources.streamAsString(is);\n</code></pre> In this case the file hobbit.txt would be in the location */src/main/resources/input/hobbit.txt*.  You can stream a string content directly by using the following code:  <pre><code>String textContent = resources.retrieveFileAsString(\"/textFiles/test1.txt\");\n</code></pre>  This uses the same methods as the previous example but is one less line of code you have to write.  Substituting variables into a file  As you read a file from the local bundle you might want to substitute values into the file before retrieving it.  This is called within Galasa as retrieving a skeleton file from the bundle.  The first step is to create a HashMap containing the name of the variables that you want to be substituted in the target file, as well as the value that should be used.  <pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; parameters = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();\nparameters.put(\"ACCOUNT_NUMBER\", \"123456789\");\nparameters.put(\"AMOUNT\", \"50.05\");\n</code></pre>  In this case we are adding two items to the HashMap, setting the substitute values for both ACCOUNT_NUMBER and AMOUNT.  This HashMap is then passed to the retrieveSkeletonFile method.  <pre><code>InputStream is = resources.retrieveSkeletonFile(\"input/hobbit.txt\", parameters);\nString textContext = resources.streamAsString(is);\n</code></pre>  When the file is now retrieved from the local bundle all references to ++ACCOUNT_NUMBER++ and ++AMOUNT++ will be substituted for \"123456789\" and \"50.05\" respectively.  Note that these substitutions are for the instance of the test that is running.  The actual copy of the file in the bundle is unchanged and cannot affect any other instances of the test that are running at the same time.  From Galasa 0.8.0 this has been updated to allow you to retrieve the content of a file directly as a string and still perform variable substitution as the following example shows:  <pre><code>String textContext = resources.retrieveSkeletonFile(\"input/hobbit.txt\", parameters);\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/managers/core-manager.html","title":"Core Manager","text":"<p>This Manager is at Release level.

Specify a folder in the RAS in which to store test result output  If you want to produce output to allow compares to be done when tests fail, you can elect a folder in which to store the output by using the _@StoredArtifactRoot _ annotation on an _IPath_ object.   Use the following example to understand the code that needs to be added to the test class:  <pre><code>@StoredArtifactRoot\n    public Path rasRoot;\nPath jobOutput = \\\nrasRoot.resolve(\"zosBatchJobs\").resolve(\"checkOutputIsStoredInRAS\");\nFiles.write(jobOutput, content.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n</code></pre>  The `resolve` method finds the directory (or creates one if needed) and a file is then created in the RAS by using the PATH API.   Using the Test Property annotation  This example has the following CPS properties set in the CPS file:   test.projectA.first.choice.data=3  test.projectA.first.data=2  where `projectA` is the prefix, `data` is the suffix, and `first` and `choice` are infixes.

If _test.projectA.first.choice.data_ is not found, then property _test.projectA.first.data_ is used instead.   Example - using the Resource String and Logger annotation  The following example imports the @ResourceString annotation and sets the tag name to `myString` and the string length to `4`. The value of `myResourceString` is written to the log which is automatically stored in the Result Archive Store (RAS) by the Galasa framework.   <pre><code>@ResourceString(tag=\"myString\", length = 4)\npublic IResourceString myResourceString;\n\n    @Test\n        logger.info(myResourceString.getString());    \n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/managers/docker-manager.html","title":"Docker Manager","text":"<p>This Manager is at Release level.

Using the Docker Manager in this way means that the test or administration team  do not need to create dedicated JMeter resources.   Containers that are provided by the Docker Manager can be used to either drive  workload for the application under test, or to receive workload from the application.  The Docker Manager can also be used to monitor the test or to provide a security context like  OpenLDAP. Docker Containers provide a powerful tool in helping test applications in an integrated environment.  The Docker Manager supports Galasa Shared Environments.  Shared Environments provide  the ability to create a test environment that can be shared across multiple test runs  so you don't have to provision a test environment for each test.</p>"},{"location":"docs/managers/docker-manager.html#limitations","title":"Limitations","text":"<p>The Docker Manager supports only AMD64 platforms.

The test can request as many containers as required within  the limits set by the Docker Manager configuration. | | Attribute: `dockerContainerTag` |  The <code>dockerContainerTag</code> is used to identify the Docker Container to other Managers or Shared Environments.  If a test is using multiple  Docker Containers, each separate Docker Container must have a unique tag. If two Docker Containers use the same tag, they will refer to the  same Docker Container. | | Attribute: `image` |  The <code>image</code> attribute provides the Docker Image that is used to create the Docker Container.  The image name must not  include the Docker Registry as this is provided in the CPS.   If using a public official image from DockerHub,  then the  image name must be prefixed with <code>library/</code>, for example <code>library/httpd:latest</code>, the Docker Manager will not default to the library namespace like the Docker commands do. | | Attribute: `start` |  The <code>start</code> attribute indicates whether the Docker Container should be started automatically. If the  test needs to perform some work before the container is started, then <code>start=false</code> should be used, after which  <code>IDockerContainer.start()</code> can be called to start the container. | | Attribute: `dockerEngineTag` |  The <code>dockerEngineTag</code> will be used in the future so that a container can be run on a specific Docker Engine type. You would not normally need to provide a Docker Engine tag. | | Syntax: | <code>@DockerContainer(image=\"library/httpd:latest\") public IDockerContainer httpdContainer; @DockerContainer(image=\"privateimage\", start=false) public IDockerContainer container1; </code> | | Notes: | The <code>IDockerContainer</code> interface gives the test access to the IPv4/6 address and the exposed port numbers of the Docker Container.  The interface also enables the test to execute commands and retrieve the log and transfer files that are sent to  and from the container. See DockerContainer and IDockerContainer to find out more. |   Docker Container Configuation  | Annotation: | Docker Container Configuation | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | @DockerContainerConfig | | Description: | The code&gt;@DockerContainerConfig annotation provides an object to manually configure certain aspects of a containers run. Within the annotation, volumes can be requests, for both binding and provisioning. Look at the Docker volume annotation  description for more details. The IDockerContainerConfig object it self allows for non provisioing configurations to be set at test time and  ammended between container startups. The IDockerContainer object needs to use the startWithConfig() method to take use of the customised  startup config | | Attribute: `dockerVolumes` |  Multiple volumes can be mounted within a single configuration  @return | | Syntax: | <code>@DockerContainerConfig(      dockerVolumes =  { |   Docker Volume  | Annotation: | Docker Volume | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | @DockerVolume | | Description: | The code&gt;@DockerVolume annotation provides the capability to bind or provision docker volumes. The  volumes were desgined with three Docker volume use cases in mind:  1. Mounting configuration - in this usecase any volume to be mounted contains configuration data and must not be edited by the running      container, as this could affect parallelization of test running. Therefore, in the DockerVolume annotation, if a volume name is provided      (aka already exists), the mount will be read only.  2. Sharing volumes - when a volume is required for multiple containers to use to share data. This shoult not be a provided volume, so it      is expected that a volume name will not be passed to the DockerVolume annotation, and the docker engine will generate a name. This      volume will be tagged for later reference. Current limitation is that the config used to provision the volume must be used for all      containers wanting to mount the same volume. This results in the path having to be the same in all containers.  3. Persisting data - There may be a use case for a volume to exsist outside the life span of the test. For this I have encorparated a      boolean called persist on the DockerVolume annotation. This is not indefinate, but controlled by resource management. A good default      would probably be 24 hours, but can utimately be set by the user with a CPS property. | | Attribute: `existingVolumeName` |  By default it is expected that Galasa should provision and control the volume. This field should only be used if beinding to an already exisitng volume.  @return | | Attribute: `mountPath` |  Where to mount the volume on the container.  @return | | Attribute: `volumeTag` |  When wanting to reference a mount that is going to be provisioned, this tage will be used.  @return | | Attribute: `dockerEngineTag` |  The <code>dockerEngineTag</code> will be used in the future so that a volume can be allocated on a specific Docker Engine type. You would not normally need to provide a Docker Engine tag.  @return | | Attribute: `readOnly` |  This field is used to protect this volume. If this volume is intended to be mounted to multiple containers, which you do not want  editing the contents, set this to be true  @return | | Syntax: | <code>@DockerContainerConfig(      dockerVolumes =  {           // A read only mount, as a specific volume was requested. |"},{"location":"docs/managers/docker-manager.html#code-snippets","title":"Code snippets","text":"<p>Use the following code snippets to help you get started with the Docker Manager.</p> Create a Docker Container  The following snippet shows the minimum code that is required to request a Docker Container in a Galasa test:  <pre><code>@Dockercontainer(image=\"library/httpd:latest\", tag=\"http\", start=true)\npublic IDockercontainer container1;\n</code></pre>  The code creates a Docker Container with an Apache HTTP Server running on port 80. Although this does not provide much, it does give a known target HTTP Server that you can start and stop in order to test how your application responds in those circumstances.  By accessing the *container1* field, you can find the IP address and port that was used for the container.    At the end of the test, the Docker Manager automatically stops and discards the Docker Container. If for some reason the test was not able to do this, the Docker Manager resource management routines perform the same clean up after the Galasa Ecosystem discovers the test has disappeared.  There is no limit in Galasa on how many Docker Containers can be used within a single test. The only limit is the number of Docker Containers that can be started in the Galasa Ecosystem. This limit is set by the Galasa Administrator and is typically set to the maximum number of containers that can be supported by the Docker Server or Swarm.  If there are not enough slots available for an automated run, the run is put back on the queue in *waiting* state to retry. Local test runs fail if there are not enough container slots available.  Obtain the IP address and port of an exposed container port  Find the IP address and port by using the following code which provisions and starts an Apache HTTP server on port 80:  <pre><code>@Dockercontainer(image=\"library/httpd:latest\")\npublic IDockercontainer httpcontainer;\n...\nInetSocketAddress port80 = httpContainer.getFirstSocketForExposedPort(80);\n</code></pre> Stop and Start a container  Stop and start your Apache HTTP Server to test how your application responds by using the following code:  <pre><code>@Dockercontainer(image=\"library/httpd:latest\")\npublic IDockercontainer httpcontainer;\n...\nhttpContainer.stop();\n\nhttpContainer.start();\n</code></pre> Run a command in the container  Use the following code to execute a command within the Docker Container and return the resulting output: <pre><code>@Dockercontainer(image=\"library/httpd:latest\")\npublic IDockercontainer httpcontainer;\n...\nIDockerExec exec = httpContainer.exec(\"ls\",\"-l\",\"/var/log\");\nexec.waitForExec();\nString output = exec.getCurrentOutput();\n</code></pre> Retrieve the log of the container  Use the following code to retrieve the container log:  <pre><code>@Dockercontainer(image=\"library/httpd:latest\")\npublic IDockercontainer httpcontainer;\n...\nString log = httpContainer.getStdOut();\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/managers/docker-manager.html#configuration-properties","title":"Configuration Properties","text":"<p>The following are properties used to configure the Docker Manager.</p> Docker Engine DSE CPS Property  | Property: | Docker Engine DSE CPS Property | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | docker.dse.engine.[engineTag] | | Description: | A property that allows a image to be tagged, and then selected from a test class | | Required:  | No | | Default value: | PRIMARY | | Valid values: | An ID for the engine, e.g. LOCAL | | Examples: | <code>docker.dse.engine.PRIMARY=LOCAL </code> |   Docker Engine CPS Property  | Property: | Docker Engine CPS Property | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | docker.engine.[engineId].hostname | | Description: | Provides location of the Docker Engine | | Required:  | Yes - the hostname of the Docker Engine must be provided | | Default value: | None | | Valid values: | A valid DNS name or IPv4/6 address | | Examples: | <code>docker.engine.[engineId].hostname=docker.example.company.org docker.engine.[engineId].hostname=192.168.2.3 </code> |  Currently, the Docker Manager supports only a single Docker Engine although it is planned to allow multiple Engines to be configured.

Users belonging to particular roles should be used throughout your tests. Their interactions on each unique CICS region under test and the resulting Security Definitions of those interactions, will be recorded.</p> <p>The Security Definitions found in the test will be available as a report within the <code>sdv</code> folder of the test runs Stored Artifacts, in human-readable, YAML format. If no Security Definitions were witnessed in a test run, the report will contain a message indicating this. The reports will be grouped and named, firstly by the Java test package name, then secondly by each tested CICS region tag within the test class. For example:</p> <pre><code>dev.galasa.sdv.tests/dev.galasa.sdv.tests.featurea.TestClassOne.SDVCICSA.cics-security.yaml\ndev.galasa.sdv.tests/dev.galasa.sdv.tests.featurea.TestClassOne.SDVCICSB.cics-security.yaml\ndev.galasa.sdv.tests/dev.galasa.sdv.tests.featureb.TestClassTwo.SDVCICSA.cics-security.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>Users must be obtained for use within your test via the <code>@SdvUser</code> annotation. This annotation will allocate the test a user belonging to a role mapped to the provided <code>roleTag</code> (see SDV Role CPS Property below), for use on a provided CICS region via the provided <code>cicsTag</code>. All Security Definitions used by this user on the specified CICS region will be recorded. If the user interacts with a CICS region different from the stated one, those security accesses will not be recorded, a seperate <code>@SdvUser</code> would need to be declared to record those interactions. If a <code>cicsTag</code> is not provided, <code>PRIMARY</code> is assumed. Users are allocated from a pool of users. As an example, the following obtains a user which will conduct interactions on CICS Region tag <code>A</code> that belongs to the role mapped to the <code>R1</code> roleTag in the CPS properties:</p> <pre><code>@SdvUser(cicsTag = \"A\", roleTag = \"R1\")\npublic ISdvUser user1;\n</code></pre> <p>The SDV manager will ensure that a user is only allocated to one test, per CICS Region at any one time to avoid Security Definition \"noise\". When a test run ends, the user will be released back to the pool for the next test to use. If there are no available users in the pool because they are all already allocated, the test will fail with an <code>ResourceUnavailableException</code>. The Galasa framework will then continue to re-attempt to run the test at fixed periods of time until a user is available and the test can run.</p> <p>To ensure the Security Definitions are consistent for each run of a test, any resources that are created by the test should have a fixed name. As an example, if a datetime stamp is used in a resource naming strategy, this would be different each time the test is ran, therefore the Security YAML will be different each test run, which will be found if running any kind of before/after comparison.</p> <p>This manager can be used within a Continuous Integration pipeline to identify, and validate changes in Security Definitions as a result of a request to change application, or test code.

Navigating around a web page browser <pre><code>page.clearElementByCssSelector(\"input.js-search-input.search__input--adv\");\npage.sendKeysToElementByClass(\"js-search-input.search__input--adv\", \"Galasa\");\npage.clickElementById(\"search_button_homepage\");\n</code></pre>  The code showcases different actions which can be performed on a web page interface to interact with different WebElements on the Browser. These WebElements are selected using a range of different techniques which allows the tester flexibility in how they are selected.  Extracting web page information <pre><code>WebElement element = page.findElementById(\"search_button_homepage\");\nString pageTitle = page.getTitle();\nString pageSource = page.getPageSource();\n</code></pre>  The code shows different ways of gaining information about the web page to be tested against. Extracting the title is a very simple way of checking if the WebDriver is on the correct page and making sure that a WebElement is found."},{"location":"docs/managers/selenium-manager.html#configuration-properties","title":"Configuration Properties","text":"<p>The following are properties used to configure the Selenium Manager.</p> Selenium Available Drivers CPS Property  | Property: | Selenium Available Drivers CPS Property | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | selenium.driver.type | | Description: | Describes the selenium driver types that can be selected. | | Required:  | No | | Default value: | $default | | Valid values: | A valid String the describes any of the supported drivers: FIREFOX,CHROME,OPERA,EDGE | | Examples: | <code>selenium.available.drivers=CHROME,FIREFOX,OPERA,EDGE</code> |   Selenium Default Driver CPS Property  | Property: | Selenium Default Driver CPS Property | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | selenium.default.driver.type | | Description: | If set, describes the default the selenium driver that will be used. | | Required:  | No | | Default value: | $default | | Valid values: | A valid String representation of a type.

Multiple z/OS console images can be requested by a test. <p> See the zOS Manager for details of the z/OS Console Annotations. <p> This implementation is less rich than the zOS/MF implementation due to the restricted functionallity of oeconsol: <p> <ul> <li>oeconsol does not directly support console name.     Console name can be used to avoid clashes with other consoles that the user has open, e.g. in another Galsa test, in a TSO or SDSF session.         When supplying console name via <code>IZosConsole#issueCommand(String command, String consoleName)</code> the Manager attempts to obtain credentials         from the CPS, i.e. <code>secure.credentials.[consoleName].username</code>. The credentials are used to logon to z/OS UNIX and execute oeconsol with the supplied command.   </li> <li>oeconsol does not support retrieving delayed responses.     A <code>ZosConsoleException</code> is will be thrown when the <code>IZosConsoleCommand#requestResponse()</code> method is called.   </li> </ul> <p> See oeconsol for documentation and download</p>"},{"location":"docs/managers/zos-console-oeconsol-manager.html#configuration-properties","title":"Configuration Properties","text":"<p>The following are properties used to configure the zOS Console oeconsol Manager.</p> The oeconsol path  | Property: | The oeconsol path | | --------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | | Name: | zosconsole.oeconsole.[imageid].command.path | | Description: | The path to the oeconsol command | | Required:  | No | | Default value: | oeconsol | | Valid values: | A valid PATH environment variable or a full path name | | Examples: | <code>zosconsole.oeconsole.command.path=oeconsol</code> <code>zosconsole.MFSYSA.oeconsol.command.path=/tools/oeconsol</code> where <code>/tools/oeconsol</code> is the locations of the oeconsol executable|"},{"location":"docs/managers/zos-console-zos-mf-manager.html","title":"zOS Console zOS MF Manager","text":"<p>This Manager is at Beta level.

It sits above another component called SimPlatform. As delivered, SimBank implements a sample banking application against which you can configure and run a set of provided tests in preparation for running your own tests against an actual mainframe application. You can also practice writing some new tests to run against the SimBank banking application.</p> <p>By exercising the Galasa framework against SimBank, you can pre-empt a lot (but not all) of the work and learning necessary to eventually hook your own tests up with a genuine mainframe environment. If the provided SimBank tests do not work, then it is unlikely that you will be able to run your own tests on a mainframe application. In summary, SimBank helps you to understand Galasa's basic principles of operation before you learn how to connect Galasa to your own mainframe application-under-test. Start by installing Galasa Simbank, either using the  Running Galasa SimBank online documentation if you are working with the Galasa CLI repository in GitHub, or the Running Galasa SimBank offline documentation if you are using the Galasa zipped distribution.</p> <p>Galasa SimBank comes with a selection of prepared Galasa tests. You can find out more about these tests in the following sections. Follow the flow of logic in these classes and understand more about the Java that is used to create them, including how to use Galasa annotations and review documented test methods. A good place to start is with the SimBank IVT documentation. You can then move on to look at the other tests that are provided with Galasa.

The SimBank Basic Account Credit test is available in the  Galasa simplatform repository in GitHub. </p> <p>To run this test, follow the same steps as for <code>SimBankIVT.java</code> but using the test class name <code>BasicAccountCreditTest</code> instead of <code>SimBankIVT</code>. </p> <p>The spine of this test resembles that of <code>SimBankIVT.java</code>, with a nearly-identical collection of imports and invoked Managers within the main test class - <code>BasicAccountCreditTest</code> in this case.</p> <p>After registering the password as confidential text, the code uses the facilities of the 3270 terminal in much the same way as the previous example to retrieve an account balance: <pre><code>coreManager.registerConfidentialText(\"SYS1\", \"IBMUSER password\");\n\n//Initial actions to get into banking application\nterminal.waitForKeyboard()\n    .positionCursorToFieldContaining(\"Userid\").tab().type(\"IBMUSER\")\n    .positionCursorToFieldContaining(\"Password\").tab().type(\"SYS1\")\n    .enter().waitForKeyboard()\n\n    //Open banking application\n    .pf1().waitForKeyboard()\n    .clear().waitForKeyboard()\n    .tab().type(\"bank\").enter().waitForKeyboard();\n\n//Obtain the initial balance\nBigDecimal userBalance = getBalance(\"123456789\");\n</code></pre> Note that the <code>userBalance</code> is obtained by calling the private method <code>getBalance</code> - it is not annotated with <code>@Test</code>, and so will (correctly) not be identified to Galasa as a test method.

Using the <code>imageTag=\"SIMBANK\"</code> argument with <code>@ZosImage</code> allows you to associate an instance of a Manager with a set of configuration properties.

Once defined, Galasa can dynamically select an image from that cluster at run time.</p> <p>For example, you might want to define a cluster called CLUSTER2 which contains two z/OS images called IMAGEA and IMAGEB. You can do this by udpating the CPS file to define CLUSTER2 and the images that you want it to contain, along with the properties of those images, as per the following example:</p> <pre><code># CLUSTER2\nzos.cluster.CLUSTER2.images=IMAGEA,IMAGEB\n\nzos.image.IMAGEA.ipv4.hostname=winmvs2a.example.com\nzos.image.IMAGEA.telnet.port=23\nzos.image.IMAGEA.telnet.tls=false\nzos.image.IMAGEA.credentials=WINMVS2A\nzos.image.IMAGEA.max.slots=1\nzos.image.IMAGEA.clusterid=CLUSTER2\nzos.tag.IMAGEA.clusterid=CLUSTER2\n\nzos.image.IMAGEB.ipv4.hostname=winmvs2b.example.com\nzos.image.IMAGEB.telnet.port=23\nzos.image.IMAGEB.telnet.tls=false\nzos.image.IMAGEB.credentials=WINMVS2A\nzos.image.IMAGEB.max.slots=1\nzos.image.IMAGEB.clusterid=CLUSTER2\nzos.tag.IMAGEB.clusterid=CLUSTER2\n</code></pre> <p>The images are linked back to the CLUSTER2 cluster by using  the following code: </p> <pre><code>zos.image.IMAGEA.clusterid=CLUSTER2\nzos.image.IMAGEB.clusterid=CLUSTER2\n</code></pre> <p>In the test code, set the imageTag to CLUSTER2, as per the following example:</p> <pre><code>@ZosImage(imageTag=\"CLUSTER2\")\n   public IZosImage image;\n</code></pre> <p>When the test runs, Galasa dynamically selects either IMAGEA or IMAGEB from CLUSTER2 at run time. </p> <p>For example, in the CPS file IMAGEA has a maximum number of slots set to <code>1</code>. If that slot is in use, Galasa binds the test to IMAGEB at run time, if IMAGEB is available. Images can be added to CLUSTER2 by updating the CPS file, without the need to recompile the test. </p> <p>In this way, Galasa manages the inbound workload of tests and splits them across LPARS. Each LPAR has a certain number of slots that are allocated to it. When the slots are used, no more tests can be allocated to that LPAR.

Despite the fact that when you first start working with Galasa, you may be running tests locally, sequentially, and against just a single target environment, it is recommended that you follow these guidelines to develop good habits for testing in the large.</p> Expect a test to be run multiple times in parallel  - In a CI/CD pipeline, it is very likely that an automated test will be running against different target environments at the same time. - When using remote resources, ensure their use will not clash with another test instance. - Use the Galasa framework to understand which test instance you are testing against. - Do not hard code any locations, ports or names in your tests - these might change. - Do not assume a specific number of test environments - this might scale dynamically.    Do not hard code resource names  - If you have not developed an application Manager to describe your target environment, then use test properties to pass resource names to the test. - If you hard code resource names, application ids, target hostnames and so on, it means that the test is not portable. You will be unable to run the same test against a development target environment one day and a QA environment the next. - By not hard coding resource names, you reduce the technical debt being built up within your test code.    Many short, sharp tests are far better than a few long tests  - Lots of short, sharp tests means you can run more tests in parallel. Galasa's ecosystem has been designed for scale, and can cope with thousands of tests running in parallel. - In a CI/CD pipeline, the more parallelism you can introduce, the more testing can happen in the shortest time, meaning your developers can receive feedback faster. - A single test class that takes an hour to run six test methods can be run in ten minutes if those six methods could be split apart and run in parallel.    Use the facilities provided by Managers instead of writing your own code  - If there is a Manager that does what you need, then use it instead of writing your own code in the test. Managers' code uses best practice and has been battle-proven. If a better solution for a Manager arrives, your tests will automatically benefit. - As you write your own tests, you will discover common code between them that could be abstracted into an Application Manager, so expect some churn and volatility as your test's functionality settles down. - Using Managers helps to reduce the technical debt building up in your test code.    Understand the difference between testing and exercising code  - When you test a specific function, you will generally examine all parts of it - that is, all aspects of the UI and API, and confirm that any logging or audit messages are printed correctly. However, once satisfied that it is working, you might want to exercise that function while testing another function. When simply exercising a function, you can choose to not examine all parts of it as if you were testing it, and just accept that it works or not. This speeds up your tests.    Use <code>@Before</code> and <code>@After</code> to clean up state <ul> <li>A method annotated with <code>@Before</code> runs before each test method. This can be very useful for resetting resources such as HTTP clients or screens before each test invocation. Similarly, a method annotated with <code>@After</code> only runs after each test method, and again can be used for resetting resources after a test method completes.   </li> </ul> Understand your meta-information  - Meta-information held within annotations in your test class can be built into a test catalog and used when selecting tests to run or reporting on tests that have run. - How will you divide up your tests? Will this be based on functional area, type of test performed and so on? Codify this into each test through annotations as soon as you can to inject structure into your tests.    Scope tests well  - Although you might be creating integration tests with Galasa that require interactions with many components, it is important that each test is scoped to test just a single application function. - Test classes that test multiple functions don't scale well, and are more difficult to maintain and debug as they will contain a lot of information.    Make tests easy to debug  - Use the logger via the `@Logger` annotation to pepper the run log with test state, possibly logging variables pertinent to the running test. This will help align the run log and the test class when analysing a problem. There is an example of this annotation in the SimBank `ProvisionedAccountCreditTest` example. - When your test encounters an error, use the logger to be explicit about the type of error encountered. Messages such as `Did not see the expected result` are far less useful than `Expected to see message-A but actually saw message-B`. - Use the Stored Artifact facility to save test material that will help you to diagnose test failures when tests are running in an unsupervised manner. It is annoying when the rerun of a test works flawlessly, but you know perfectly well that there is still a bug in there somewhere. - The Stored Artifact facility can flag particularly interesting information. Use it in failure scenarios to raise engineers' attention to the key failure-causing output. There is an example of this annotation in the SimBank `ProvisionedAccountCreditTest` example.    Your test code is a valuable asset  - Your automation test code is just as important to your business as your application code, as it is a key indicator of application quality. - If your test code is poor, the whole view of the quality of your application is jeopardised. - All test code should be source control managed. - Consider using a static code analyser or performing buddy checks to ensure your test code is of a high quality."},{"location":"docs/writing-own-tests/running-test-modes.html","title":"Running a Galasa test","text":"<p>Overview Running a test locally Running a test in the Ecosystem Running a test locally but using shared configuration When to run a test in the Ecosystem When to run a test locally</p>"},{"location":"docs/writing-own-tests/running-test-modes.html#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>There are three modes in which you can run a Galasa test: -  locally, with everything running on the local machine -  locally but using a shared configuration that is hosted by the Galasa Ecosystem -  remotely, by submitting the test to run in the Galasa Ecosystem </p> <p>If you are running a test locally but using a shared configuration that is hosted by the Galasa Ecosystem, or running a test remotely by submitting the test to run in the Galasa Ecosystem, you are interacting with the Galasa Ecosystem. </p> <p>Before you can interact with the Galasa Ecosystem, you must authenticate with it by using a personal access token.

This parameter is mandatory. Use the provided example to help you to understand how you might create unique names for your Java test packages. Sections can reflect your company, organisation, the application under test, or any other name-spacing of your choice. The value chosen influences the names of the folders, OSGi bundles, Maven coordinates, and the eventual Java package name in which example tests are created. The name must be all lower-case letters and numbers (<code>a-z</code>, <code>0-9</code>), with <code>.</code> (period) character separators.

The entries in this list influence the names of some folders, OSGi bundles, Maven coordinates and Java class names of the generated example tests. In the example provided, the banking application under test has a <code>payee</code> section and an <code>account</code> section which need testing. Creating subcomponents of your test suite to test these features or components of the application creates a naming structure in which your tests can be organised.

Use this option carefully to avoid some of your files being over-written, resulting in the loss of some of your data. - <code>--obr</code> Creates an OBR project. An OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) is an index of OSGi bundles. Galasa testcases are built into OSGi bundles which are then connected into an OBR.

Test streams give you more options when it comes to organising your test projects, how often they are built and where they are deployed.</p> <p>You can have as few or as many test streams as you wish.</p> <p>A stream is a group of tests that you wish to run in automation represented by a single OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) and its equivalent test catalog. Galasa uses an OBR to locate your tests in a Maven repository, along with all of the Managers that a test project requires. A test catalog is generated directly from the test source, is always up to date, and is what you would specify in the Galasa CLI to select tests to run in automation.</p> <p>There are many ways to organise test streams:</p> <ul> <li>Single test stream: A single test stream can contain all of your tests. This system is of most use when you are learning about Galasa and experimenting with the automation system. At some point, it is much more beneficial for you to move to a dual stream setup.</li> <li>Dual test streams: Often, you will need to run a production test stream and a best so far test stream. The production stream is used by the CI/CD pipeline to test the application, while the best so far stream will include tests under development that you wish to observe under automation.</li> </ul> <p>The source code for tests in dual streams is usually from the same SCM (Source Code Management) area - in git terms, this would mean the same repository but in different branches. The best so far stream contains all of the production stream tests plus new or modified tests. When you are happy that a test has reached a good level of quality, you can promote it to the production stream and make it available to the CI/CD pipeline. Usually, you would organise things so that you have a Maven build per stream.</p> <ul> <li>Many streams: You might organise your streams so that you have one per team, or dual test streams per team. If you have lots of tests per application area, having a stream per area is also possible.</li> </ul> <p>Build time and frequency usually dictates how streams are structured. If you are building your test projects frequently, and those build times are long, you might wish to split the test projects into streams. Alternatively, you could stick with a single stream, but split the projects into separate builds that all kick off the build of the test stream OBR when complete.</p>"},{"location":"docs/writing-own-tests/writing-test-classes.html","title":"Writing test classes","text":"<p>Having created your project structure and built the parent and sub-projects, you are ready to start writing your own test classes.</p>"},{"location":"docs/writing-own-tests/writing-test-classes.html#the-anatomy-of-a-galasa-test-class","title":"The anatomy of a Galasa test class","text":"<p>Some classes have <code>internal</code> as part of their package name.

Doing this allows the Galasa Maven plugin to differentiate between test and utility classes within a project. Only classes that use <code>@Test</code> are included in the test catalog.</p> <p>Once loaded by the Galasa test runner, there are a few further annotations that dictate how a test is executed. These are <code>@BeforeClass</code>, <code>@Before</code>, <code>@Test</code>, <code>@After</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>.

Such methods are executed by Galasa by the order in which they appear in the test class - from top to bottom. If a test method fails, the following test methods are bypassed to encourage short, sharp parallel testing. This behaviour can be overridden using the <code>@StopOnError</code> annotation on the <code>class</code> statement.</p> <p>When a test method succeeds it is marked as PASSED, and if there is an exception it is marked FAILED. Managers can override this marking - for example, if a test throws a specific exception, a Manager could set the result to DISASTER.</p> <p><code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>  Methods marked <code>@Beforeclass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code> are executed once before and once after all tests in the class respectively. They are executed in the order they appear in the sources.</p> <p>Such methods are used to perform setup and tear-down for the test class, for example, setting up an HTTP server that all of the <code>@Test</code> methods will use.</p> <p>Unlike JUnit, these are not static methods as they need access to some class fields/manager annotated fields which are described later.</p> <p>Failures that occur in <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code> usually cause tests to fail with <code>ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE</code>, which indicates that the test itself didn't fail, but the set up did for some reason. For this reason, <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code> should not contain any test code.</p> <p><code>@Before</code> and <code>@After</code>  Methods marked <code>@Before</code> and <code>@After</code> are executed before and after every <code>@Test</code> method respectively, in the order in which they appear in the source.</p> <p>These methods are typically used to reset resources before a test or perhaps check logs for post-test error messages.</p> <p>Failures that occur in <code>@Before</code> and <code>@After</code> result in the test method being marked as FAILED, as it is likely that such methods contain test checking code.</p> <p>Manager annotated fields  Before any of the <code>@</code> methods in a test class are executed, the Galasa test runner requests any active Managers to populate their test fields with appropriate values.

If a field cannot be populated by a Manager, the test is marked either as <code>ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE</code>, or as <code>RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION</code> in which case an automated rerun is queued.</p> <p>A few Managers provide direct access to themselves, for example the Core Manager:</p> <pre><code>@CoreManager\npublic ICoreManager coreManager;\n</code></pre> <p>The Core Manager provides a method to obtain credentials via an ID - but the test may not know the ID before it runs, so it would be difficult to do this via an annotated field.</p>"},{"location":"docs/writing-own-tests/writing-test-classes.html#example-tests","title":"Example tests","text":"<p>Review the SimBank sample tests to see how these principles are applied in practice.

Use the information to revoke an access token.  - The default size of the PVC storage allocated by the Helm chart is increased from 1GB to 30GB and automatic history compaction is now turned on by default to minimise the risk of etcd running out of space.  - The unused WebUI `/webui/worklist` endpoint and `dev.galasa.api.webui` bundle are removed from the API server to resolve reported vulnerabilities.  - Various bug fixes  - Various documentation updates  0.33.0 - Release Highlights  - Authentication when interacting with an Ecosystem is now mandatory. You need to authenticate with an Ecosystem in order to use its API server or to use any galasactl commands that interact with an Ecosystem.   - CouchDB is upgraded to version 3.3.3. If you upgrade your Ecosystem to Galasa version 0.33.0, CouchDB will be upgraded. Though we don't anticipate any problems with the Helm chart upgrading CouchDB in-situ, we recommend that you follow the usual safety practices of backing up your data prior to any upgrade. You can then apply the backup to the new CouchDB pod after it is created. CouchDB cannot be downgraded after upgrading.  - Maven and Gradle plugins now accept a personal access token when publishing a test catalog to the Ecosystem.  - Various bug fixes  - Various documentation enhancements, including property updates for the CICS TS and z/OS Managers, and information on updating credentials in an Ecosystem.  0.32.0 - Release Highlights  - CLI updates:     \u2022 You can re-try running a test run which appears to be hanging or looping by using the `galasactl runs reset` command.    \u2022 You can cancel a test that is hanging or looping by using the `galasactl runs cancel` command. Cancelling a test removes all entries in the DSS for that test run. All information that is stored in the RAS about the test is kept and is not removed when either the `runs reset` or `runs cancel` command is run.    \u2022 You can run Gherkin tests locally on your machine by setting the `--gherkin` flag on the `galasactl runs submit local` command.    - Updates to the Galasa authentication token and documentation updates around authentication, architecture, and logging into and out of a Galasa Ecosystem by using the `galasactl auth login` and `galasactl auth logout` commands.  - The Eclipse plug-in for Galasa is no longer supported. You can work with Galasa version 0.32.0 and later by using the Galasa command line interface (CLI).  - Various documentation enhancements.  0.31.0 - Release Highlights  - CLI updates:     \u2022 You can explicitly specify the path to your local Maven repository folder when launching a test case by setting the `--localMaven` flag in the `galasactl runs local` command. This means that you can use a non-standard location for your local Maven repository if you want to, rather than having to use the default location of `{user.home}/.m2`.    \u2022 You can create, update, apply, and delete one or more properties to an Ecosystem by specifying a checked-in resource file on the  `galasactl resources` command, making it easy to set Ecosystem configuration with a single command.     \u2022 The `galasactl properties get` command supports extraction of properties resources in yaml format when the `\u2013format yaml` flag is set on the command so you can later apply those properties with different values by using a checked-in resource file specified on the `galasactl resources` command.    \u2022 The `galasactl namespaces get` command now returns results of available namespaces in raw format when the `\u2013format raw` flag is set on the command.   - When using the Galasa command line tool against a server, an error message is generated when the client and server versions are incompatible.   - Various documentation enhancements  - A new blog post by Louisa Seers, encapsulating her experiences during her first six months as Chair of the Galasa Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and the Galasa journey to adoption by the Open Mainframe Project (OMP), is now available on the  Open Mainframe Project website.  0.30.0 - Release Highlights  - You can now read, update, and delete CPS properties by using the CLI, removing the need to directly access the etcd server or use the REST service. The `galasactl properties set` command makes it easy to set parameters and credentials in the Ecosystem for tests to read and use at runtime. Use the `galasactl properties get` command to read CPS properties and the `galasactl properties delete` to remove CPS properties from a namespace in the Ecosystem. - The following REST API endpoints will be deprecated in the next release (0.31.0) as these are replaced by new endpoints delivered in this release:         /cps/namespace/{namespace}/property/{property}         /cps/namespace/{namespace}/prefix/{prefix}/suffix/{suffix}         /cps/namespace/{namespace}         /cps/namespace - The `--requestor` parameter is removed from the `galasactl runs submit local` and `galasactl runs submit` commands. The `--requestor` parameter is always set to the current user id, removing the ability to artifically set who is running the test.  - Various documentation updates and enhancements.  0.29.0 - Release Highlights  - Upgrade of 'bouncy castle' crypto libraries to remove a security vulnerability.  0.28.0 - Release Highlights  - Updates to the `runs get` command, including the ability to filter test run results on a specified time period, and to display the returned results in a detailed or raw format - Ability to download test run artifacts using the `runs download` command - Ability to debug a test locally using the `runs submit local` command - Various documentation updates and enhancements  0.27.0 - Release Highlights  - REST API enhancements:        * allow queries of test run details using the run name        * documentation added to the https://rest.galasa.dev/ website  - Command-line tool `galasactl` now supports:        * the `GALASA_HOME` environment variable, which you can set to avoid using the `{HOME}/.galasa` folder         * querying of test run status using the run name         * the `--development` flag for `galasactl project create` and `galasactl local init` to enable generated code to use pre-released code versions of Galasa libraries, in addition to the ones published on Maven central         * automated tests run on every build  <pre><code>\n</code></pre> 0.26.0 - Release Highlights  -  Initialise your development environment by using the  galasactl local init command -  Launch a test within a local JVM by using the galasactl runs submit local command -  Create an example project by using the galasactl project create command, which now supports --maven and --gradle flags to control which build system the caller wants to use. -  3270 images are generated in the RAS results store (experimental code for this release) -  SnakeYAML is upgraded to v1.33. This is a Java library for parsing yaml files. -  Documentation updates on using the CLI to:       - initialise your local environment       - create a project       - run a test locally -    Various doc updates and enhancements to existing content  0.25.0 - Release Highlights   -   Colour support for 3270 application streams. Tests can now validate that an application is using the correct colours and highlighting for specified field(s) and screen position. -   Various defect fixes, including fixing broken LTS connections in Java 11, updates to 3270 modifiable fields, and updates to the REST API. -   VTP Manager enhancements, including additional logging for problem diagnosis and increased keyboard wait times to minimise the risk of keyboard locking. -   New features have been added to the command-line tool:          * A `--log ` option has been added to direct log information to a file.         * The `--log -` option directs log information to the console.         * Omitting the `--log` option suppresses the log information.         * Every error is numbered. For example: `GAL1028E: Failed to unmarshal test catalog from REST reply for property 'xxx'`         * Errors appear on stderr and in the log (if logging is turned on)         * Syntax documentation is fully generated and linked to from the  README  in the cli repository.         *   galasactl is now supported on MaxOSX on arm64 architecture machines. -   Artifact Manager is updated to remove the need to create a second resources folder.  -   Upgrades have been made to some dependencies.  0.24.0 - Release Highlights   - The minimum Java release now required for Galasa is version 11, rather than version 8. You will need to install a Java version 11 JDK or later to run Galasa tests. _Note:_ We do not currently support Java 17 or later.  - Various enhancements to the DB2 Manager. - Various defect fixes.  - Various documentation fixes and enhancements.   0.23.0 - Release Highlights  - New Helm charts are available for deploying a basic Galasa Ecosystem into a Kubernetes Namespace. Documentation can be found in the  helm repository in GitHub.  0.22.0 - Release Highlights  - The z/OS 3270 Manager now supports 3 new methods ```setCursorPosition(row,col)```, ```retrieveText(row,col,length)```, and ```retrieveTextAtCursor(length)```. - The z/OS Batch Manager has a new method ```waitForJob(Second)```. - The z/OS File Manager now supports two new methods ```getMemberName()``` and ```clone(IZosVSAMDataset model)```.  0.21.0 - Release Highlights  - An initial basic version of the DB2 Manager is now available.
